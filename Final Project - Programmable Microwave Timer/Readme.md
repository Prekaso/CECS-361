Programmable Microwave Timer - created by Dylan Dang & Hoang Nguyen

This program replicates the function of a traditional microwave. 
The user is able to choose a time (by sec, min, hours) for how long they would like to heat up their food. 
There are also 3 preset timers for specific food items such as popcorn & pizza.
2 switches to start the microwave and stop/reset. 

Need fixing:
- debouncing issue when selecting time
- add flashing LED when food is ready
- add audio feedback when food is ready
